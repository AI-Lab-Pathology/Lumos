ADI:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of adipose tissue (ADI) in the tumor immune microenvironment of gastric cancer.  
Please revise the paragraph by incorporating accurate and professional descriptions of common histological changes in adipose tissue, such as lipolysis, adipocyte atrophy, immune cell infiltration (e.g., macrophages, T cells), or fibrosis,  
without altering the original meaning, and preserving its academic tone.

DEB:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of gastric cancer. 
Please revise the paragraph by adding accurate and professional references to 'debris' (e.g., necrotic, eosinophilic, mucinous, or apoptotic debris), 
**without altering the original meaning**, and preserving its academic tone.

LYM:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of lymphocyte aggregates (LYM) within the tumor immune microenvironment of gastric cancer.
# Please revise the paragraph by briefly incorporating accurate and professional references to key features of lymphocyte aggregates, such as the density, cellular composition (e.g., T cells, B cells), or their interaction with tumor or stromal regions.
# Keep the paragraph concise, preserve its original meaning, and maintain an academic tone.

MUC:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of the mucus-rich region (MUC) within the tumor immune microenvironment of gastric cancer.
# Please concisely revise the paragraph by incorporating key mucus-associated features, such as mucin pools, goblet cell morphology, or immune每mucus interactions, while preserving the original meaning and academic tone.

MUS:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of the muscular region (MUS) in the tumor immune microenvironment of gastric cancer.
# Please revise the paragraph by adding accurate and professional references to immune-related changes or histological features specific to the muscle layer, such as inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis, immune cell每muscle interactions, or structural disruption,
# **without altering the original meaning**, and preserving its academic tone.

NOR:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of the muscular region (MUS) in the tumor immune microenvironment of gastric cancer.
# Please revise the paragraph by adding accurate and professional references to immune-related changes or histological features specific to the muscle layer, such as inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis, immune cell每muscle interactions, or structural disruption,
# **without altering the original meaning**, and preserving its academic tone.
