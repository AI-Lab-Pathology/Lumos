This script processes a batch of histopathological images (H&E-stained gastric cancer tissue) by feeding them into the InternVL2-8B multimodal model to generate descriptive captions. The results are saved as .txt files corresponding to each image. The code supports multi-tile cropping for large images and rescaling for small images, ensuring the model captures both local details and global tissue structures.
