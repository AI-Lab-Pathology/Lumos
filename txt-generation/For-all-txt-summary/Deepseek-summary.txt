ADI:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of adipose tissue (ADI) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), highlighting features such as adipocyte atrophy, lipolysis, immune cell infiltration (e.g., macrophages, lymphocytes), or fibrosis. 
Maintain precision, avoid unnecessary elaboration, and ensure the summary remains academically and medically accurate.

DEB:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of debris (DEB) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), referring to necrotic, mucinous, eosinophilic, or apoptotic debris when appropriate, and emphasizing its diagnostic implications. 
Ensure the summary is medically accurate and presented in a formal academic tone.

LYM:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of lymphocyte aggregates (LYM) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), emphasizing the density, spatial distribution, and immune activity of lymphocytic infiltrates (e.g., CD8+ T cells, tertiary lymphoid structures). 
Ensure clarity, accuracy, and academic tone throughout the summary.

MUC:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of mucus (MUC) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), focusing on mucin presence, distribution, and its pathological significance in glandular differentiation or mucinous carcinoma components. 
Preserve medical accuracy and maintain a concise academic tone.

MUS:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of muscle tissue (MUS) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), referencing smooth muscle integrity, invasion patterns, or desmoplastic replacement where relevant. 
Keep the summary precise, medically rigorous, and academic in tone.

NOR:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of normal mucosa (NOR) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), contrasting preserved mucosal architecture with surrounding pathological changes, and noting cellular uniformity or glandular preservation. 
Maintain a concise, accurate, and academic presentation.

STR:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of stroma (STR) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), highlighting fibrotic components, desmoplasia, cellularity, and tumor-stroma interaction. 
Ensure the description remains focused, medically informative, and academically styled.

TUM:
You are a professional medical editor. The following is a histopathological description of tumor epithelium (TUM) within the immune microenvironment of gastric cancer. 
Please generate a highly condensed professional summary (within 3–5 sentences), emphasizing critical pathological features (e.g., epithelial atypia, glandular disruption, nuclear abnormalities, stromal interaction). 
Avoid redundancy and preserve academic tone and medical accuracy throughout.
